# Project b-m4

Hello! This is my first attempt on creating a Quiz style site. This tests my knowledge of Javascript by following questions while being timed.

## üß† User Story 

**GIVEN** I am taking a code quiz
**WHEN** I click the start button
**THEN** a timer starts and I am presented with a question
**WHEN** I answer a question
**THEN** I am presented with another question
**WHEN** I answer a question incorrectly
**THEN** time is subtracted from the clock
**WHEN** all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
**THEN** the game is over
**WHEN** the game is over
**THEN** I can save my initials and score


## üåê How to Operate!

Navigation is simple, Here is how to get started:

1. click on the "Get Started" button
2. You will then trigger the 1-minute timer to start counting down
3. Read the question
4. Choose the best Answer 
5. You will be prompted if the previous answer was correct or incorrect
6. If the timer goes off first you will be alerted to Input your Initials to save your score
7. If you go through all the questions before the timer you will be alerted to Input your Initials to save your score

## üîÆ Future Development

As a new developer, I want to keep growing and learning.
I would like to add more;
-More styling to the answer choices
-Add more questions
-Incorporate a previous questions button
